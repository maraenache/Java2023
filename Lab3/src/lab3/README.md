# AdvancedProgramming2023

## Compulsory

------

- [x] Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes Person, Company.
- [x] Both classes should implement the interface java.util.Comparable. The natural order of the objects will be given by their names.
- [x] Create the interface Node that defines the method used to obtain the name of a person or company. The classes above must implement this interface.
- [x] Create a java.util.List containing node objects and print it on the screen.

## Homework

------  
- [x] Create the complete model: Person, Programmer, Designer, Company. All persons have a birth date. Each class must have at least one specific property, that others don't have (be creative).
- [x] Each person will contain a Map defining the relathionships to other persons or companies.
- [x] Create the Network class containing a List of identifiable nodes.
- [x] Create a method that computes the importance of a node in the network, as the number of its connections to other nodes.
- [x] Create a network object containing persons, companies and relationships and print it on the screen. When printing the network, the nodes must be ordered according to their importance.

## Bonus

------  
- [x] Implement an efficient agorithm to determine if there are nodes in this networks which, if they are removed, disconnect the network.
- [ ] Identify the blocks of the network, that is subgraphs that are maximally 2-connected.
- [ ] Create JUnit tests for your algorithms.erate large random instances of the problem and analyze the performance of your algorithm (running times, memory consumption).

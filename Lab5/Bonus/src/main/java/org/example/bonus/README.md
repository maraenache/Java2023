- [x] Use Apache Tika in order to extract metadata from your catalog items and implement the command info in order to display them.

Using a minimum number of colors (labels), assign each document a color such that related documents have distinct colors.Implement using Graph4J API Brown coloring algorithm or other coloring algorithm.
- [x] Create large instances of the problem and test your algorithm (against JGraphT or other library implementations).
